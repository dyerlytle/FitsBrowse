Browser for FITS files on disk.
These will be 2-D images
X-Y cross section plots
Header information display
ROI statistics
Image stretch - min/max - histogram equalization
Use MatPlotLib for plots

Configuration file
	number of frames to show
	plots to show
	show header information
	
Show directory list, allow user to click on image to see it, perhaps
also allow decent into subdirectories or switch to directory somewhere else.

Simple Photometry?

Data Structures and Objects:
	the GUI is an object
	the current directory is an object
	each image file will be opened into an object
	the region of interest will be an object
	the settings/configuation will be an object
	the timeline will be an object
	the map of the heavens will be an object
	
3D display showing target PyQtGraph?
	probably not, can't texture a sphere in PyQtGraph!
	
However, we can show a map of the heavens and plot the position of the target.
There can be a timeline slider that will show the target on the map and show
the images as the slider is moved back and forth.  We can look through the
headers of all the images in the directory and then populate the timeline
slider with indicators of the image times.

So the user will see a list of images, they can click on any image and the
target position will be displayed, the timeline slider will move to the proper
time, and the image will be displayed in the main image window.

The user can also slide the timeline slider and the target position will move
around as they slide but I'm not sure we want to flash all the images as they
slide by, that might be confusing.  More thought needed there.
