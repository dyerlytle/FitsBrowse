We want to use the Model/View paradigm in the new version of VimsBrowse to
give us more flexibility in the way information is displayed so we can give
the user additional ways to use the program.

The Directory-Model will interact with the operating system directory system
and will present information about the files and directories found in the
Current-Directory so that the various views for this information can display
it in the main GUI window.

The main GUI window will show a Directory-List to allow the user to move
around within the operating system directory structure.

The main GUI window will show a File-Table including information from any FITS
files found in the Current-Directory.  This table will contain configurable
columns populated from the headers of the FITS files.  The user will be able
to choose the keywords to be displayed by editing a flat file stored in their
home directory in .fitsbrowse/fitsbrowse-keywords.  The table will allow
sorting on any of the columns of the table.

Image display will be done in a seperate window for each image clicked on
with simple controls for zoom, stretch, cross section, and color table.

The user will be able to examine the FITS Header for any image.
